            <h3>About Me.</h3>
            <p>I love to read, especially about psychology. Taking IB Psychology SL in my junior year of high school sparked my interest in psychology, and I've loved it ever since.</p>
            <p>I love photography. Not only do I take photos of cars and nature, but while being a manager for the Fairmont Marching Band, I was also their photographer, taking almost 12,000 photos during the 4-month season.</p>
            <p>I love music. Not only have I played the violin for 7 years for the middle and high school orchestras and the saxophone for 2 in my free time, but I've also been part of the highly selective high school musical pit orchestra for 2 years in a row, the first being Legally Blonde and Anastasia as the second.</p>
            <p>I also love traveling and both learning and trying new things. I've visited Bulgaria and France and was born and raised in Romania. Because of this, I am fluent in both Romanian and English and am proficient in Spanish due to classes I took in middle and high school and cultural influences in Romania.</p>
